# TODO

- add a filter for email (\n\n -> </p><p> + \n -> br)
- add tags conditions for some blogs (like graphicslab): only read the posts tagged with the "scribus" keyword
- put the feedlist in a csv file<br>
  (data/cache + data/feed.csv ?)<br>
  feed, url, label[,options]*<br>
  where options = option_label,option_value<br>
  (a.l.e: i have some code, i'm going to publish soon for the mapping of csv files to an entity)
- clean up the heuristics for reading the author
- check if the caching mechanism of simple pie is enough or if we need something better
- add further types of feeds / use better or multiple services for the existing ones
- add the original BSD license in the simplepie directory
- add some credits (links) for the libraries and sources used (markdown, simplepie, wallflux, ...)
- separate the logic from the template part (inside of the one file)
- add a next / preview post in the item popup
- add a "read more" / "read in context" link at the end of each entry (the link "under" the title is not enough)
