scribus-planet
==============

create a a simplepie based planet for scribus

TODO:

- create some nice HTML + CSS
- move the feed list to an external csv file
  (data/cache + data/feed.csv ?)
  feed, url, label[,options]*
  where options = option_label,option_value
  (a.l.e: i have some code, i'm going to publish soon for the mapping of csv files to an entity)
- check if the caching mechanism of simple pie is enough or if we need something more
- add further types of feeds / use better or multiple services for the existing ones
